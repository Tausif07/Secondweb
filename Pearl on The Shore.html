    <h2>Pearl on The Shore</h2>
    <p style = "font-size: 25px">
    From now, you're just another person.<br>
Youâ€™re not a pearl among thousand of grains anymore;<br>
That scatters sun rays like a bright one,<br>
And manifests its presence on the sea shore.<br>
Don't you see in every spring, when it reminds you<br>
Of those never you could forget days?<br>
Flower blooms with the tale of a never-uttered love<br>
And falls, nobody picks up, on the ground it stays.<br>
